abstract: Conventional 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally
  expensive, memory intensive, prone to overfitting, and most importantly, there is
  a need to improve their feature learning capabilities. To address these issues,
  we propose spatio-temporal short-term Fourier transform (STFT) blocks, a new class
  of convolutional blocks that can serve as an alternative to the 3D convolutional
  layer and its variants in 3D CNNs. An STFT block consists of non-trainable convolution
  layers that capture spatially and/or temporally local Fourier information using
  an STFT kernel at multiple low frequency points, followed by a set of trainable
  linear weights for learning channel correlations. The STFT blocks significantly
  reduce the space-time complexity in 3D CNNs. In general, they use 3.5 to 4.5 times
  less parameters and 1.5 to 1.8 times less computational costs when compared to the
  state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, their feature learning capabilities are significantly
  better than the conventional 3D convolutional layer and its variants. Our extensive
  evaluation on seven action recognition datasets, including Something-Something v1
  and v2, Jester, Diving-48, Kinetics-400, UCF 101, and HMDB 51, demonstrate that
  STFT blocks based 3D CNNs achieve on par or even better performance compared to
  the state-of-the-art methods.
